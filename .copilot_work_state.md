Work state snapshot - powershell-akv-audit

Date: 2025-10-15 20:48 UTC
Branch: copilot/vscode1760467044785

Summary:
- Current task: restore CSV fields, fix parsing/runtime issues in Get-AKV_Roles-SecAuditCompliance.ps1 and generate HTML from CSV.
- Edits applied:
  - Fixed unsafe inline JS/onclick quoting earlier (previous commits).
  - Added defensive Get-SafeCount and @() coercions to avoid .Count runtime errors.
  - Introduced $safeCurrentUser and ensured global:currentUser is defined to avoid unbound variable errors during template rendering.
  - Replaced three inline template occurrences that referenced $global:currentUser with $safeCurrentUser.

Last run (partial CSV -> HTML):
- Command: pwsh -File .\Get-AKV_Roles-SecAuditCompliance.ps1 -ProcessPartial -CsvFilePath .\KeyVaultComprehensiveAudit_2025-10-13_17-10-45.csv -OutputDirectory .\out
- Outcome: CSV loaded (2 records), partial CSV generated. HTML generation failed due to missing property: 'AverageProcessingTime' on $AuditStats.
- Latest error: "The property 'AverageProcessingTime' cannot be found on this object." at New-ComprehensiveHtmlReport line ~3391.

Next steps to resume tomorrow:
1. Guard $AuditStats.AverageProcessingTime access (use Get-SafeProperty or -and $AuditStats.ContainsKey('AverageProcessingTime')).
2. Search for other unguarded property accesses in New-ComprehensiveHtmlReport; add Get-SafeProperty wrappers.
3. Re-run -ProcessPartial and confirm HTML output: KeyVaultComprehensiveAudit_PARTIAL_CSV_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.html
4. Validate HTML columns and Details panel contents for restored fields.

Files changed (local branch):
- Get-AKV_Roles-SecAuditCompliance.ps1 (multiple edits around New-ComprehensiveHtmlReport and variable guards)
- .copilot_work_state.md (this file)

Notes:
- The script requires interactive prompts and may attempt to resume from checkpoints created earlier; answer 'N' if you don't want resume behavior when testing offline CSV->HTML generation.
- To run non-interactively for testing, consider temporarily setting $global:resumePromptResponse = 'N' or adjusting the resume prompt logic in the script.

If you want, tomorrow I can:
- Patch AuditStats guards and re-run the partial HTML generation to completion.
- Produce a short diff of the generated HTML showing the restored columns.

End of snapshot.
