.PARAMETER TestMode
    Optional. Run in test mode with limited Key Vaults for validation and testing.
    Recommended for initial setup validation before production runs.
    
.PARAMETER Limit
    Optional. Number of Key Vaults to test when in test mode. Default is 3.
    Only applies when TestMode is enabled.

.PARAMETER Resume
    Optional. Resume audit from a selected checkpoint file.
    If checkpoint files are found, lists all available checkpoints and allows user selection for resume point.
    If no checkpoint files are found but a master discovery file exists, automatically uses the master file 
    for optimized performance, skipping subscription discovery and access validation.
    Useful for continuing interrupted audits in large environments.

.PARAMETER ProcessPartial
    Optional. Process partial results from either a checkpoint file, master discovery file, or an existing CSV file.
    When used without -CsvFilePath, will first check for checkpoint files, then fallback to master discovery file.
    When used with -CsvFilePath, will load results directly from the specified CSV file.
    If a master discovery file is found (even without checkpoints), automatically uses it for optimized performance,
    skipping subscription discovery and access validation.
    Generates HTML/CSV reports from the loaded partial data.
    Useful for extracting results from incomplete audits without restarting the analysis.

.PARAMETER CsvFilePath
    Optional. Specify a CSV file path when using -ProcessPartial or -ReportFromCsv.
    For -ProcessPartial: If provided, the script will load partial results directly from this CSV file
    instead of prompting for checkpoint selection.
    For -ReportFromCsv: Specify the CSV file path to generate reports from.
    If not provided with -ReportFromCsv, the script will auto-detect the latest KeyVaultComprehensiveAudit*.csv file
    in the output directory.
    The CSV file should contain valid audit results from a previous run.
    When using this parameter, subscription discovery and access validation are completely bypassed.

.PARAMETER ReportFromCsv
    Optional. Generate HTML report directly from an existing CSV file without performing any Azure analysis.
    This mode is designed for generating production HTML reports from interrupted audits.
    Cannot be used with -Resume or -ProcessPartial parameters.
    Requires no Azure authentication and works completely offline.

.PARAMETER MarkPartial
    Optional. Controls whether reports generated with -ReportFromCsv are marked as "PARTIAL RESULTS".
    Can only be used with -ReportFromCsv parameter. If not specified when using -ReportFromCsv, 
    defaults to $true. Set to $false to generate reports without partial result banners.

.PARAMETER ResumeCsvStrict
    Optional. Enable strict CSV deduplication validation when resuming from checkpoints.
    If enabled, the script will warn and skip any rows that already exist in the CSV file
    based on multi-key identity matching. Helps prevent duplicate entries during resume.

.PARAMETER OutputDirectory
    Optional. Override the default output directory.
    If not specified, automatically detects:
    - Azure Cloud Shell: /home/<upn_prefix> (where upn_prefix is username before @)
    - Local environment: $env:USERPROFILE/Documents/KeyVaultAudit (Windows) or equivalent

.PARAMETER ProgressMode
    Optional. Controls how progress is displayed during vault processing.
    Valid values: 'Session', 'Overall', 'Both'. Default is 'Session'.
    - Session: Shows progress within current session (e.g., "Session: 1/972" when 1000 of 1972 already processed)
    - Overall: Shows overall progress including baseline (e.g., "Overall: 1001/1972")
    - Both: Shows both session and overall progress

.PARAMETER UnmatchedLogCount
    Optional. Number of unmatched checkpoint entries to log for diagnostics when resuming.
    Default is 10. Set to 0 to disable unmatched entry logging.
    Helps identify renamed/removed vaults or permission changes between runs.

.PARAMETER UploadToCloud
    Optional. Enable automatic upload of all output files to OneDrive/SharePoint after audit completion.
    Uses Microsoft Graph API with device code authentication for seamless integration in Azure Cloud Shell.
    Requires Files.ReadWrite.All permissions. Default is $false.

.PARAMETER CloudUploadPath
    Optional. Target folder path in OneDrive/SharePoint for file uploads when using -UploadToCloud.
    If not specified, user will be prompted to enter the target folder path.
    Examples: "/Documents/KeyVaultAudits", "/Shared Documents/Security/Audits"

.PARAMETER ResumeSourcePriority
    Optional. Controls which sources contribute to the processed identity set when resuming.
    Valid values: 'Checkpoint', 'CSV', 'Union'. Default is 'Union'.
    - Checkpoint: Use checkpoint data only
    - CSV: Use existing CSV file data only  
    - Union: Combine both checkpoint and CSV data (recommended for robustness)

.PARAMETER ResumeStrictMatch
    Optional. Enable strict matching validation when resuming.
    If enabled and the baseline match percentage falls below the threshold, the script will abort 
    with a clear error message before processing begins.
    Helps detect significant mismatches between checkpoint/CSV data and current discovery.

.PARAMETER StrictMatchThresholdPercent
    Optional. Minimum percentage of processed identities that must match discovered vaults when 
    -ResumeStrictMatch is enabled. Valid range: 1-100. Default is 60.
    If the match percentage falls below this threshold, processing is aborted with recommendations.

.PARAMETER GraphClientId
    Optional. Client ID (Application ID) for Microsoft Graph app-only authentication.
    If provided along with GraphTenantId and GraphClientSecret, enables app-only authentication mode.

    Valid values: 'Interactive', 'App', 'DeviceCode', 'Auto'. Default is 'Auto'.
    
    Authentication Method Descriptions:
    - Interactive: Browser-based authentication (optimal for local desktop environments)
    - App: App-only authentication using client credentials (optimal for automation scenarios)  
    - DeviceCode: Device code flow authentication (fallback when other methods fail)
    - Auto: Automatically select based on environment detection and available credentials
    
    Enhanced Auto-Detection Logic (Priority Order):
    1. Service Principal credentials detected (env vars/parameters) → App authentication
    2. Azure Cloud Shell environment detected → Interactive authentication  
    3. Managed Identity environment without credentials → DeviceCode authentication
    4. Local desktop environment → Interactive authentication (with DeviceCode fallback)
    
    Az.Accounts Context Integration:
    - Automatically detects tenant/client IDs from current Az.Accounts context
    - Leverages existing managed identity authentication when available
    - Provides verbose logging of auto-detection decisions and fallback reasons  
    3. Managed Identity environment without credentials → DeviceCode authentication
    4. Local desktop environment → Interactive authentication (with DeviceCode fallback)
    
    Environment Detection Uses:
    - $env:CLOUD_SHELL, $env:ACC_CLOUD (Cloud Shell indicators)
    - $env:MSI_SECRET, $env:AZURE_HTTP_USER_AGENT (MSI/automation indicators)  
    - $env:AZURE_CLIENT_ID, $env:AZURE_TENANT_ID, $env:AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET (credentials)
    - Az.Accounts context analysis for managed identity authentication
    1. Complete Service Principal credentials available → App-only authentication
       - Checks parameters: GraphClientId, GraphTenantId, GraphClientSecret
       - Checks environment: AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
       - Preferred in ALL environments when credentials are available
    
    2. Local environment (non-Cloud Shell) → Interactive browser authentication
       - Uses Microsoft Graph PowerShell modules with browser sign-in
       - Automatic fallback to device code if modules unavailable
    
    3. Azure Cloud Shell environment (without app credentials) → Device code authentication  
       - Device code authentication used as FALLBACK ONLY, not default
       - Interactive user prompts when MSI/app-only authentication fails
       - Clear explanations of each authentication method provided to users
    
    Enhanced Error Handling & User Guidance:
    - Comprehensive error logging with environment context and authentication details
    - Interactive prompts when primary authentication fails (when Interactive=true)
    - Clear explanations of device code vs browser login options  
    - Detailed troubleshooting information logged for failed authentication attempts
    
    Environment Detection Indicators:
    - Cloud Shell: $env:CLOUD_SHELL, $env:ACC_CLOUD, $env:AZUREPS_HOST_ENVIRONMENT
    - MSI/Automation: $env:MSI_ENDPOINT, $env:IDENTITY_ENDPOINT, $env:IMDS_ENDPOINT
    - Az.Accounts context analysis for current authentication state
    - Comprehensive logging shows which detection logic matched and why

.PARAMETER GraphScopeScenario
    Optional. Determines the Microsoft Graph permission scopes requested during authentication.
    Valid values: 'Files', 'Sites', 'Full'. Default is 'Files'.
    - Files: Basic file operations (Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All)
    - Sites: Enhanced SharePoint operations (adds Sites.Manage.All, Sites.FullControl.All)
    - Full: Comprehensive enterprise permissions (adds User.Read, Directory.Read.All)

.PARAMETER SingleVault
    Optional. Run targeted diagnostics scan for a single Key Vault instead of full organizational scan.
    This mode is designed for quick testing and validation of diagnostic settings configuration.
    
    When enabled:
    - Prompts for Key Vault name (or use -VaultName parameter)
    - Searches across all accessible subscriptions to locate the specified vault
    - Performs comprehensive diagnostics analysis including RBAC, access policies, and network config
    - Generates focused CSV and HTML reports for just that vault
    - Completes in seconds/minutes vs hours for full organizational scans
    - Cannot be used with -Resume, -ProcessPartial, or -ReportFromCsv parameters
    
    Perfect for:
    - Testing diagnostic settings after configuration changes
    - Validating specific vault compliance before production deployment
    - Troubleshooting diagnostic logging issues on individual vaults
    - Quick verification of Azure Portal configuration vs script output

.PARAMETER VaultName
    Optional. Specify the Key Vault name when using -SingleVault mode.
    If not provided, the script will prompt interactively for the vault name.
    The vault name is case-sensitive and must match exactly.
    
    Example: -SingleVault -VaultName "MyCompanyProdVault"
    
    When used with -SubscriptionName, the script will search only within the specified subscription.
    If -SubscriptionName is not provided, the script will search across all accessible subscriptions.
    If the vault is not found, the script will display helpful troubleshooting guidance.
    
.PARAMETER SubscriptionName
    Optional. Specify the subscription name or ID when using -SingleVault mode.
    If not provided, the script will prompt interactively for the subscription (allowing blank for full enumeration).
    Accepts both subscription display names and subscription IDs (GUIDs).
    
    Example: -SingleVault -SubscriptionName "Production" -VaultName "MyCompanyProdVault"
    Example: -SingleVault -SubscriptionName "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc" -VaultName "MyVault"
    
    When provided, significantly speeds up vault discovery by targeting only the specified subscription
    instead of enumerating all accessible subscriptions. Leave blank when prompted to fall back
    to normal enumeration across all subscriptions.

    - Skip tracking: Detailed logging and reporting of skipped subscriptions with actionable guidance
    - Partial processing: Generate reports from incomplete audits at any time
    
    Optimized Performance Features:
    - Master file discovery: First run creates a master discovery file with all subscriptions and Key Vaults
    - Optimized resume: Resume operations automatically load from master file, skipping subscription discovery
    - Optimized partial processing: ProcessPartial operations use master file or CSV, bypassing discovery entirely
    - Smart bypass: When master files exist, subscription discovery and access validation are automatically skipped
    - Performance gains: Master file operations can reduce startup time from minutes to seconds
    - Clear messaging: Script clearly indicates when optimized mode is used vs full discovery

function Connect-GraphWithStrategy {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Connect to Microsoft Graph using improved multi-mode authentication strategy with environment-aware defaults
    .DESCRIPTION
    Implements robust authentication flow with intelligent environment detection:
    1. Interactive browser authentication for local/desktop environments (default)
    2. App-only/MSI authentication for Cloud Shell/automation environments with auto-detection
    3. Device code authentication as fallback with user-friendly prompts
    
    Includes comprehensive verbose logging and Az.Accounts context integration.
    Connect to Microsoft Graph using multi-mode authentication strategy with enhanced error handling and user guidance
    .DESCRIPTION
    This function implements a comprehensive Microsoft Graph authentication strategy that:
    1. Automatically detects the environment (Azure Cloud Shell, local, MSI-enabled)
    2. Prioritizes MSI/app-only authentication in cloud environments  
    3. Uses device code authentication only as a fallback, not as default
    4. Provides detailed error logging with context information
    5. Offers interactive user guidance when automatic methods fail
    6. Logs all authentication attempts and environment detection logic

        <h4>🔐 Secrets Management Terms & Best Practices:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Secret Access Monitoring:</strong> Comprehensive logging and auditing of all secret access attempts, including who accessed what secrets, when, and from where. This enables detection of unauthorized access patterns and compliance reporting.</li>
            <li><strong>Granular Secret Access:</strong> Fine-grained permissions using Azure RBAC instead of broad access policies. This allows specific roles like 'Key Vault Secrets User' for read access only, rather than full vault permissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Secret Recovery Protection:</strong> Soft delete functionality that allows recovery of accidentally deleted secrets within the retention period (7-90 days), preventing permanent data loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Secret Rotation:</strong> Microsoft recommends automated rotation every 90 days for high-value secrets. Consider implementing Azure Functions or Logic Apps for automated rotation workflows.</li>
            <li><strong>Secret Versioning:</strong> Key Vault automatically versions secrets. Leverage this for rollback capabilities and audit trails.</li>
            <li><strong>Application Integration:</strong> Use Key Vault references in Azure App Service and Azure Functions instead of hardcoding secrets in application configurations.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>📊 Compliance & Security Insights:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Audit Trail:</strong> $(if ($AuditResults.Count -gt 0) { 
                $diagnosticsCount = ($AuditResults | Where-Object { $_.DiagnosticsEnabled -eq "Yes" }).Count
                $percentage = [math]::Round(($diagnosticsCount / $AuditResults.Count) * 100, 1)
                "$percentage% of vaults have diagnostic logging enabled"
            } else { "Diagnostic logging status unknown for partial data" }), providing visibility into secret access patterns and potential security incidents.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Isolation:</strong> $(if ($AuditResults.Count -gt 0) { 
                $privateEndpointCount = ($AuditResults | Where-Object { [int]$_.PrivateEndpointCount -gt 0 }).Count
                $percentage = [math]::Round(($privateEndpointCount / $AuditResults.Count) * 100, 1)
                "$percentage% of vaults use private endpoints"
            } else { "Private endpoint usage unknown for partial data" }), protecting secrets from unauthorized network access.</li>
            <li><strong>Identity-Based Access:</strong> $(if ($AuditResults.Count -gt 0) { 
                $rbacCount = ($AuditResults | Where-Object { $_.RBACAssignmentCount -gt 0 }).Count
                $percentage = [math]::Round(($rbacCount / $AuditResults.Count) * 100, 1)
                "$percentage% of vaults use RBAC"
            } else { "RBAC usage unknown for partial data" }) for granular secret permissions instead of legacy access policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Secret Recovery:</strong> Soft delete is enabled on $(if ($AuditResults.Count -gt 0) { 
                $softDeleteCount = ($AuditResults | Where-Object { $_.SoftDeleteEnabled -eq "Yes" }).Count
                $percentage = [math]::Round(($softDeleteCount / $AuditResults.Count) * 100, 1)
                "$percentage% of vaults"
            } else { "unknown percentage for partial data" }), enabling secret recovery in case of accidental deletion.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>⚠️ Common Secrets Management Risks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardcoded Secrets:</strong> Avoid storing secrets directly in application code, configuration files, or environment variables.</li>
            <li><strong>Over-Privileged Access:</strong> Applications with broad Key Vault permissions increase attack surface.</li>
            <li><strong>Stale Secrets:</strong> Unused or forgotten secrets should be regularly audited and removed.</li>
            <li><strong>Weak Secret Generation:</strong> Use cryptographically secure random generators for password and key generation.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-Environment Leakage:</strong> Ensure proper isolation between development, staging, and production secrets.</li>
        </ul>

# --- Minimum Required Permissions Documentation ---
$MinimumPermissions = @"
MINIMUM REQUIRED PERMISSIONS FOR RUNNING THIS SCRIPT:

Azure RBAC Permissions (at Subscription or Management Group level):
- Reader: Required to discover and read Key Vault configurations
- Key Vault Reader: Required to access Key Vault properties and settings
- Monitoring Reader: Required to access diagnostic settings and logs

Optional permissions for enhanced analysis:
- Security Reader: For security-related configurations and recommendations
- Key Vault Crypto Service Encryption User: For key usage analysis (if analyzing key operations)

Azure AD Permissions (for service principal and managed identity analysis):
- Directory Readers: To read Azure AD objects and service principals

ENHANCED AUTHENTICATION METHODS AND ENVIRONMENT DETECTION:

The script now includes robust environment detection and automatic authentication mode selection:

Azure Authentication (for Key Vault operations):
1. Interactive authentication: Connect-AzAccount (optimal for local desktop environments)
2. Service principal authentication: Connect-AzAccount -ServicePrincipal (optimal for automation)
3. Managed identity authentication: Connect-AzAccount -Identity (for Azure resources with MSI)

Microsoft Graph Authentication (for OneDrive upload):
1. Interactive browser: Optimal for Cloud Shell and local environments with browser access
2. App-only (client credentials): Optimal for automation and environments with service principal
3. Device code: Fallback when browser and app-only authentication are not available

Enhanced Environment Detection Logic:
- Azure Cloud Shell: $env:CLOUD_SHELL, $env:ACC_CLOUD, shell patterns, filesystem indicators
- Managed Identity: $env:MSI_SECRET, $env:IDENTITY_ENDPOINT, $env:AZURE_HTTP_USER_AGENT patterns
- Service Principal: $env:AZURE_CLIENT_ID, $env:AZURE_TENANT_ID, $env:AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
- Az.Accounts context analysis for authentication type detection

Automatic Authentication Selection:
1. Complete service principal credentials detected → App-only authentication
2. Azure Cloud Shell environment detected → Interactive browser authentication
3. Managed Identity environment without credentials → Device code authentication (Graph)
4. Local desktop environment → Interactive authentication with device code fallback
5. Cannot determine environment → Interactive prompt with clear explanations

Device code authentication is now used only as a true fallback when other methods fail or
are explicitly requested by the user. The system provides comprehensive verbose logging
to explain each authentication decision and auto-detects tenant/client IDs from Az.Accounts context.

Known Issue with Managed Identity Authentication:
- Some managed identity configurations may experience "ExpiresOn token format" errors
- Error message: "ManagedIdentityCredential authentication failed: The following token provider result value is invalid: ExpiresOn"
- This script includes enhanced error handling for this issue and will continue operation
- If persistent, switch to interactive or service principal authentication
- Troubleshooting: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-troubleshoot

MINIMUM PERMISSIONS FOR KEY VAULT ADMINISTRATION:

Key Vault Owner/Administrator should have:
- Key Vault Administrator: Full administrative access to Key Vault
- Key Vault Certificates Officer: Manage certificates
- Key Vault Secrets Officer: Manage secrets
- Key Vault Keys Officer: Manage keys

Best Practice - Use RBAC instead of Access Policies:
- Assign specific Key Vault roles rather than broad access policies
- Use managed identities for applications instead of service principals
- Enable audit logging and monitoring
- Implement private endpoints for network security
- Use Azure Policy for governance and compliance

SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Enable soft delete and purge protection
- Use Event Hub or Log Analytics for centralized logging
- Implement network restrictions (private endpoints or network ACLs)
- Regular access reviews and principle of least privilege
- Use Azure Sentinel for advanced threat detection

    .SYNOPSIS
        Displays available checkpoints and prompts user for selection.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
        Robust helper function for checkpoint selection that lists available checkpoint files 
        with metadata (name, last modified date, progress) and prompts for user selection by number.
        Handles cancellation (Enter for none or 'q' to quit) and invalid input gracefully.
        
    .PARAMETER Checkpoints
        Array of checkpoint objects with FilePath, FileName, Data, LastModified properties.
        
    .PARAMETER Mode
        Selection mode: "Resume" or "ProcessPartial" - affects display text and behavior.
        
    .PARAMETER IsManualCancellationRecovery
        If true, limits display to last 3 checkpoints for manual cancellation recovery scenarios.
        
    .OUTPUTS
        Returns selected checkpoint object or $null if cancelled/invalid.

# --- Enhanced Authentication Mode Selection ---
function Get-AuthenticationMode {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Determines the optimal authentication mode based on comprehensive environment detection and user guidance
    .DESCRIPTION
    Performs intelligent environment detection to select the most appropriate authentication method.
    Uses enhanced detection logic for Azure Cloud Shell, MSI/automation environments, and service principal
    credentials. Provides clear user guidance and explanations when manual selection is required.
    
    Authentication Decision Flow:
    1. Azure Cloud Shell Detection → Interactive browser authentication (optimal for Cloud Shell)
    2. Managed Identity Detection → MSI authentication (optimal for Azure compute)
    3. Service Principal Credentials → App-only authentication (optimal for automation)
    4. Unknown Environment → Interactive user prompt with detailed guidance
    
    Enhanced Detection Methods:
    - Cloud Shell: Multiple environment variables, filesystem indicators, process detection
    - MSI/Automation: MSI endpoints, identity headers, Azure context analysis
    - Service Principal: Environment variable validation for complete credential sets
    - Fallback: Interactive prompts with authentication method explanations

# --- Enhanced Auth Handling with User Detection ---
function Initialize-AzAuth {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Initialize Azure authentication with enhanced environment detection and comprehensive logging
    .DESCRIPTION
    Performs Azure authentication using enhanced environment detection and authentication flow mapping.
    Includes comprehensive logging of the authentication method selected and the reasoning behind it.
    Supports Cloud Shell, MSI, Service Principal, Interactive, and Device Code authentication flows.
    
    Authentication Flow Decision Logic:
    1. Check for existing valid Azure context (unless -Force specified)
    2. Use Get-AuthenticationMode for intelligent environment-based authentication selection
    3. Log authentication method selection with detailed reasoning
    4. Perform authentication with appropriate method and comprehensive error handling
    5. Validate token expiration and refresh if needed
    
    Supported Authentication Methods:
    - Managed Identity: For Azure compute resources with MSI enabled
    - Service Principal: For automation scenarios with client credentials
    - Interactive Browser: For local development and user authentication
    - Device Code: For environments without browser access or as fallback

This indicates significant drift between your resume sources and current vault discovery:
• Sources found: $($uniqueSourceIdentities.Count) unique identities
• Current discovery matched: $baselineProcessed identities  
• Match ratio: $matchRatio% (threshold: $StrictMatchThresholdPercent%)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Run with -Verbose to see detailed unmatched identity lists
2. Try different -ResumeSourcePriority: 'Checkpoint', 'CSV', or 'Union'
3. Consider running without -ResumeStrictMatch if drift is expected
4. Verify your resume data is from the same environment/tenant

To proceed anyway, remove -ResumeStrictMatch or lower -StrictMatchThresholdPercent.
