- Comprehensive results summary with 5 major sections:
  - Diagnostics Analysis
  - Compliance Analysis  
  - Access Analysis
  - Workload Analysis
  - Network Security
  - Recommendations
- Better error messages and troubleshooting guidance
- Color-coded status indicators

## Files Modified

### Main Script: `Get-AKV_Roles-SecAuditCompliance.ps1`
**Lines Modified:** 8923-9140 (SingleVault implementation section)
**Changes:**
- Replaced basic result hashtable with comprehensive PSCustomObject
- Added workload analysis, compliance scoring, and security recommendations
- Enhanced HTML report generation with executive summary
- Improved console output with detailed analysis summary

## Files Added

### 1. `SINGLEVAULT_TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
Comprehensive testing guide including:
- Prerequisites and setup requirements
- 4 detailed test scenarios with expected behaviors
- CSV and HTML output validation procedures  
- Specific diagnostic settings test cases
- Performance expectations and troubleshooting guide

### 2. `Validate-SingleVaultOutput.ps1`
Automated validation script that:
- Verifies all 65+ expected CSV columns are present
- Validates data integrity for key fields
- Checks diagnostic settings data population

- **Comprehensive validation** of diagnostic settings configuration
- **Detailed compliance analysis** for individual vaults

### For Development and Troubleshooting
- **Consistent output structure** between single-vault and full-audit modes
- **Enhanced error reporting** with specific diagnostic guidance
- **Automated validation tools** for output verification
- **Detailed test procedures** for quality assurance

### For Production Use
- **Pre-deployment validation** for individual vaults
- **Quick compliance checks** for specific vaults
- **Detailed diagnostic configuration verification**
- **Comprehensive security assessment** in single-vault context

## Technical Implementation Details

### Function Dependencies
The enhanced SingleVault mode now uses these advanced functions:
- `Get-WorkloadAnalysis` - Analyzes vault contents and usage patterns
- `Get-OverPrivilegedUsers` - Identifies over-privileged RBAC assignments
- `Get-ComplianceScore` / `Get-ComplianceStatus` - Dual framework compliance scoring
- `New-SecurityRecommendations` - Generates context-aware security recommendations
- `New-ComprehensiveHtmlReport` - Produces full-featured HTML reports

### Data Structure Alignment
The result structure now exactly matches the main audit PSCustomObject, ensuring:
- Consistent CSV column structure across all modes
- Uniform HTML report formatting
- Compatible data processing and analysis
- Seamless integration with existing report tooling

## Validation and Quality Assurance

### Automated Tests
- Parameter validation testing
- Syntax validation for all PowerShell code
- CSV structure validation with 65+ column verification
- Output data integrity validation

### Test Coverage
- Basic single vault analysis
- Interactive vault name entry
- Vault not found scenarios
- Parameter validation edge cases
- Diagnostic settings validation for various configurations
- Performance and timing validation

This enhancement transforms the SingleVault mode from a basic diagnostic tool into a comprehensive single-vault audit solution that provides the same depth of analysis as the full organizational audit.
