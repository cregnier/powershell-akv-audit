# PowerShell Try/Catch Syntax Fix - Summary

## Issue
The PowerShell script `Get-AKV_Roles&SecAuditCompliance.ps1` failed to load in PowerShell 7+ with the following syntax error:
```
Line 4082: Unexpected token '}' in expression or statement.
Line 4087: Unexpected token '}' in expression or statement.
```

## Root Cause
The `New-ComprehensiveHtmlReport` function (starting at line 2936) contained a premature try-catch-close section at lines 3020-3025 that incorrectly closed the function. This left approximately 1,000 lines of otherwise valid PowerShell code (lines 3027-4087) orphaned outside any function, creating invalid syntax.

The premature closure appeared to be from an incomplete migration to a template-based HTML generation approach. The function had:
1. A valid `try` block starting at line 2978
2. Code that calls `Use-HtmlTemplate` and returns at line 3018 (lines 3011-3018)
3. **An incorrect catch-close section at lines 3020-3025** ← This was the problem
4. ~1000 lines of inline HTML generation code that was left orphaned (lines 3027-4087)
5. The proper function end with its own catch block at lines 4082-4087

## Fix Applied
Removed 7 lines (3020-3025) containing the premature try-catch-close section:
```diff
-    } catch {
-        Write-Host "❌ Failed to generate comprehensive HTML report: $_" -ForegroundColor Red
-        Write-ErrorLog "ComprehensiveHTML" "Failed to generate comprehensive HTML report: $($_.Exception.Message)"
-        return $false
-    }
-}
-        
```

This minimal change allows the function to continue to its proper end, bringing all the previously orphaned code back inside the function where it belongs.

## Validation Results

### PowerShell Parser Validation
- ✅ **No syntax errors** (validated with PowerShell AST parser)
- ✅ **46,719 tokens** parsed successfully
- ✅ **47,507 AST nodes** generated correctly

### Try/Catch/Finally Block Balance
- ✅ **152 try blocks**
- ✅ **151 catch blocks**
- ✅ **1 finally block**
- ✅ **Perfectly balanced** (152 = 151 + 1)

### Functional Tests
- ✅ Script loads successfully with `Get-Help`
- ✅ All 90 functions defined correctly
- ✅ No orphaned catch blocks detected
- ✅ Help system works correctly

## Testing
Run the validation test to verify the fix:
```powershell
pwsh ./Test-SyntaxFix.ps1
```

## Impact
- **Before**: Script could not be loaded in PowerShell 7+ due to syntax errors
- **After**: Script loads and executes properly in PowerShell 7 and later
- **Breaking Changes**: None - this is a syntax fix only
- **Functional Changes**: None - all code paths remain the same

## Files Modified
1. `Get-AKV_Roles&SecAuditCompliance.ps1` - Fixed premature function closure (7 lines removed)
2. `Test-SyntaxFix.ps1` - New validation test to verify the fix

## Note on Unreachable Code
After the fix, there is unreachable code in the `New-ComprehensiveHtmlReport` function (lines 3020-4080). This code exists after a `return $true` statement at line 3018, so it will never execute. However, this is not a syntax error and does not prevent the script from loading or executing. The unreachable code appears to be legacy inline HTML generation that was kept as fallback but is no longer used since the template-based approach was implemented.

If desired, this unreachable code could be removed in a future cleanup, but such removal was outside the scope of this syntax-fix-only change.
